### Abstract

This study is a *replication* of:

> [Week 07 Lab: Urban Environmental Justice of Green Space Access in Chicago](https://github.com/t-sutter/RPr-Chicago-Greenspaces/blob/main/docs/report/originalStudy.pdf), Human Geography with GIS, Middlebury College

The study replicates the lab *Urban Environmental Justice of Green Space Access in Chicago* within a Python coding language environment. The study reproduces an analysis of inhabitants' access to green space in Chicago. The original lab was performed in QGIS. The reproduction compares the geospatial tools of QGIS and the GeoPandas Python package and transitions the analysis from a graphical user interface (GUI) system to script based system.
